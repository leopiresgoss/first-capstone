# First Capstone Project - Elderly Care Conference 

> My first capstone project developed at Microverse.

![screenshot]()

The main objective was to develop the home and about pages based on CC Global Summit 2015 website.
As we could choose the topic for this project, I came up with the idea to create a conference website about elderly care. I selected this topic because it is necessary to improve elderly health care as people are getting older. 

This conference does not exist in real life as well as the speakers. Their images were generated at [This person does not exist](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en).
